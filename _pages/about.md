Hello! I am a second year undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), majoring in [Information Systems](https://www.cmu.edu/information-systems/) with an additional major in Computer Science. I am excited about computer systems, software, and data analytics. In the past summer, I worked as a research intern at the [Kurnikova Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/chemistry/people/faculty/kurnikova.html) where I developed Python wrappers to streamline bash scripting and processed data from molecular dynamics simulations, enhancing ML-guided relative binding free energy calculations. I also tested and troubleshot AMBER software protocols for computational small molecule drug discovery, ensuring robust performance and accuracy by comparing results with experimental data from research partners. Before coming to CMU, I was originally from Shanghai, China and I went to high school in Melbourne, Australia.

Projects
======
**Dynamic Memory Allocator** - June 2024
* Developed a dynamic memory allocator in C, implementing malloc, free, realloc, and calloc functions, enhancing efficiency and performance.
* Optimized allocator through segregated free lists, significantly improving utilization by 17%, throughput and reducing fragmentation.
* Designed and implemented a comprehensive heap consistency checker, ensuring robust debugging and reliable memory management.

**Cache Simulator** - May 2024
* Developed a cache simulator in C, supporting various cache configurations with LRU replacement policy and write-back, write-allocate policies to emulate real-world cache behavior.
* Designed and developed a command-line tool for simulation configuration and input file handling. Optimized matrix transpositions.

**Maze Navigation Game Design Project** - Nov 2023
* Developed an interactive maze navigation game, adhering to MVC architecture.
* Utilized pathfinding algorithms such as DFS and Primâ€™s for maze generation, and object-oriented programming for character movement in Python.
